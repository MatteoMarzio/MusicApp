## Welcome to MusicApp 
This is a beta, so please alert me for problems or bugs!


### Functions

MusicApp allows users to listen to music everywhere (like Spotify or Deezer). In this case this app is considered for personal-use only. So is not my fault if you publish copyrighted music. I provide only the application.

### Versions and Characteristics
__Version 1.0__

  - No multiple file uploading allowed
  - All users can modify albums and songs
  - No advanced protection (only hash + salt)
  - No personal user profile


### Support or Contact

This will help me to improve English and Computer Science knowledge!
