## Welcome to MusicApp 


__This is a project that i won't upgrade anymore. This is only an unstable and unsecure project intended only to learn how to use PHP, SQL and file extentions when uploading. Use only for educational purposes.__


### Functions

MusicApp allows users to listen to music everywhere (like Spotify or Deezer). In this case this app is considered for personal-use only. So is not my fault if you publish copyrighted music. I provide only the application.

### Versions and Characteristics
__Version 1.0__

  - No multiple file uploading allowed
  - All users can modify albums and songs
  - No advanced protection (only hash + salt)
  - No personal user profile


### Support or Contact

I won't offer anymore help for this code, because this project was a test to learn PHP, file uploads and SQL.
